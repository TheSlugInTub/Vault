This document is going to cover human anatomy, the skeleton, ligaments, bones, muscles, and skin.
# Skeleton
---
The skeleton is the frame of the body, and the foundation that your muscles, tendons, ligaments, and skin are on top of.
## Skull
---
The skull is the house of the brain, and the structure of your face.

### Mandible
The mandible is the lower jaw, it houses the lower teeth. It is the only movable part in the skull.
It connects with the skull in a kind of wrench-like pattern, where the forward part of the wrench shape is sharper and alike to a shark fin, and the backward part protrudes backwards and is a natural organic circle.
The corner of the mandible (downwards from the connection), is a bit sharp, and protrudes slightly outwards. The mandible can be broken into two shapes, a flat rectangular one at the bottom which houses the lower teeth, and a vertical thick wrench-like shape which connects it to the skull.

### Zygomatic
The zygomatic is the cheekbone, it has a very angular and triangular shape.
Its upper half is connected to the eye socket, its middle part is sort of a bridge between the mid-part of the skull (area below your eye socket), to the sides of your skull. And this bridge goes further with the zygomatic arch. The space below the zygomatic is non-existent.
# Muscles
---
### Platysma
The platysma is a muscle on your neck, it is used for pulling down the mandible (jaw) to make facial expressions or scream. It is a thin sheet of muscle situated on the front of your neck, but not in the middle, it is on the sides. When you pull down the mandible, it becomes visible as thin strips of muscle.
### Sartorius
The sartorius is a long and thin muscle wrapping around the leg, it originates from the outer sides of the hip down to the inward side of the knee.

### Magnus Adductor
The magnus adductor is a muscle which is part of the hip adductors which are the muscles on the upper and inwards part of the thigh, they help bring the leg and thighs together, and stabilize the legs and body.
The magnus adductor is a muscle that is on the inner side of the thigh.

### Rectus Femoris
The rectus femoris is a fairly large muscle on slightly the outer part of the front of the thigh. 
It's important to note that it is slightly outwards from the center of the thigh. You're gonna have the magnus adductor on the inwards of the thigh when looking at any photo.

# Skin

### Nasal labial fold
The nasal labial fold is the wrinkle between the two hemispheres of your nose to the corners of the mouth. It's the thing that makes old people look old.
