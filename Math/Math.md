## Symbols
---
$Σ$ or 'sigma' is the summation operator, it indicates that you are iterating over an array.
$Σi$ would be iterating over all values of $i$, $i$ could be 1, 2, 3, 4... and so on.
$θ$ is the angle of an object.
## Terminology
---
In physics, 'derivative' means how many times you're calculating the rate of change of something.
Acceleration is the first derivative of velocity, because it's measuring the rate of change of velocity.
And velocity is the first derivative of position because it's measuring the rate of change of position.
So, acceleration would be the second derivative of position.
You could say that velocity is 'derived' off of position.
Velocity and acceleration is discussed in greater detail in [[Physics]].
### Circles
A circle's diameter is the entire length of the circle. A circle's radius is half the diameter.
