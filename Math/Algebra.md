Algebra is composed of variables and figuring out how to find them, it's useful for many, many things. Variables are symbols that hold a value, this value is often unknown and variables are most often represented with a x, y or z.
## Exponents
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exponents are a little number or variable on top of another number or variable. For example: 3².
This means that 3 is multiplied by itself 2 times: $3 * 3$. The number being multiplied is called the base, and the number, the base is being multiplied is called the exponent.

***The Product Rule***
$2³ * 2²$ is the same as 2⁵, because you're multiplying $2*2*2 * 2*2$. You're just adding up the number of times 2 is being multiplied.

***The Quotient Rule***
$x⁶ / x²$ is the same as $x⁶⁻²$, 

***The Power Rule***
$(x²)³$ is the same as the two exponents being multiplied, because you're repeating $x²$, three times, and adding them up.

***Fractional Exponents***
$x⅓$ is the same as the cube root of x. If the exponent was ½, it would be the square root.

***Misc.***
A negative number in the numerator can be attributed to a positive number in the denominator.
For example, $x²z⁻³$ can be written as $x²/z³$. 
## Algebraic Equations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Take an equation, for example: $x + 2 = 5$. This is saying that when you add 2 to x, it is equal to 5. How do we figure out the value of x? We perform the inverse of what we have applied to x (Addition in this case). We remove the 2 from one side, and then we minus the 2 from 5 on the other side. And we get 3. 
Let's take another equation: $4d = 20$. This is saying that when you multiply d by four, it is equal to 20. What is the opposite of multiplication? Division. So we can divide 20 by four, and we can remove the $4d$ and replace it with just $d$.
### Equations with variables on both sides.
Take an equation for example: $3x-4=5x+2$. How will we figure out the value of x?
We can first remove $5x$ from both sides of the equation, resulting in:
$-2x-4=2$. We can then add 4 to the 2, resulting in: $-2x = 6$. And then finally, all that's left is to divide 6 by -2, which results in $-3$. Remember that one side of the equation will affect the other side as well, so you have to apply operations on both sides.
