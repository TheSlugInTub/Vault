A logarithm is the opposite of an exponentiation, a logarithm is as division is 
to multiplication.

A logarithm takes two inputs, a base and a number: n.
It returns what number the base must be exponentiated by for it to result in n.
For example: the log10 of 1000 is 3 because 10 exponentiated by 3 is 1000.
