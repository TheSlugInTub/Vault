I've just finished Pathologic 2. I absolutely loved the game. I first heard about it in hbomberguy's video and felt
compelled to play the sequel. It wasn't as grueling and pain-inducing as anyone made it out to be, like I was enjoing
most of the game and didn't feel the soul-crushing aspect all that much. I found the game to be really compelling
from the start, I always wanted to play and see what would happen and where the plot lead to. The survival mechanics
were quite good and I felt like I had to plan my every step.

I had done a previous playthrough where I got stuck on day 7 with no food, no sleep, and in an infected area, so I 
made a new save.

In the playthrough, I saved Murky, and all the other kids with the panaceas that I had brewed with the blood in the
Abattoir, except Grace. I didn't have enough panacea, shmowders or time for her. 
I used a panacea on myself after I got infected at the crowstone in the Murky quest. I felt really bad for her, 
as after her adoption with Peter, Peter died. And then Alexander died soon afterwards, and then she died. Heartbreaking.

I also saved Lara and Notkin with shmowders when they got infected. The people I grew closest to were Murky and 
Sticky, Lara, Rubin, and Grief. The two kids and the gang. The kains all died, except for Khan. Didn't really care
about them too much. The two Vlads lived, I didn't really want big Vlad to live since he doesn't care about the Kin,
but he lived anyways. Eva and Yulia also ended up dying, didn't care about them.

I chose to destroy the Polyhedron as (I think) it was the only way to get enough blood to cure the people with 
panacea. I didn't care about the town's miracles. I cared about the people in it. A great deal of progress would be 
lost with destroying the Polyhedron but what good is progress if everyone's dead of sand pest first.
If I hadn't killed the heart, which was the source of the plague, then the sand pest would (I think) forever remain,
and people would have to live like cattle under the kin. I didn't want this as humans deserve to be more than animals,
our minds are our biggest strength. Yes the kin would be greatly weakened (and die I think) but that is a sacrifice 
I had to make for humanity's future.

Also the part after the Abattoir where the map was shaped like a bull was so cool and all the kids in the list moved 
to the blood section was awesome. I really felt like I had completed a spritual journey.

The ending section where I got to chat with all the characters was cool, after all the chaos I went through, the 
stress of hunting down the couriers, after having to deal with the army, the whole town being infected with plague, 
it's nice to have a calm segment where I get to chat with everyone and chill out. (Also why the hell did Sticky and 
Murky want to stay in Isidor's house, he literally got murdered there and blood is stained on the floor, also the  
house is creepy as hell, and weirdly designed. It would be much nicer to stay in the lair.)
Also Mark Immortell popped up in my people list only after finishing the game, I don't know if this was meant to happen,
or if I just didn't meet Mark the entire time (I never went to the pantomimes, maybe that's why).

I never figured out what the deal with Clara/Changeling was. Why is she sometimes called Clara and sometimes called 
Changeling? What even is she? She seems to be a personification of the plague, since she infected me at the crowstone,
so why is she still alive at the end, and how does she know about the crowstone incident at the cape at the end, if 
the one at the cape is supposed to be the 'good' one?

I think this is the best game I've ever played, topping over Dark Souls 1.

The only time I cheated was in the Abattoir because I couldn't get past the worms. (Shameful, indeed)
