characterized by the blackening of the veins and degenerates your brain

# Gameplay

You have health. You have hunger. You have exhaustion which you can
bring down by sleeping, but sleeping increases hunger.

You can buy food, weapons, clothing, bandages and medicine in shops 
with money. You can get money by selling stuff in shops. 
You can get money by completing quests that NPCs can give to you.
You can get food, money and supplies by robbing houses but this will
cause people to attack you and you will lose reputation.
Your health will go down by people, enemies and robbers attacking you.

You have a set time limit of 10 days to do stuff in. Quests are bound by
time. Some quests have a time limit of 2 hours to do them in, and others
have a limit of 5 days.
Quests aren't generic like: "Collect 10 chicken feathers and I will give 
you a reward.". They're more like: "I need you to investigate this band 
of criminals for information about their leader" and then you get into a 
goose chase for the leader and find out the criminals lied to you who the 
leader was and they've alreeady wreaking havoc, and then you go to the 
guy who gave you the quest and he orders you to kill the criminals and
gives you money after you dispose of them.

You also have a diary in which quests are written down. There will be no 
markers on the map. The map will have buildings and places marked down 
withtheir names and the quests will tell you which place to go to, but 
won't make it super obvious on the map.
