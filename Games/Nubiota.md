# Nubiota

Nubiota is a survival game.
It is mostly inspired by Pathologic and Darkwood.

# Story

You are a young child named Ilya who has gotten on a train to go 
somewhere but the train gets derailed and lands in the Norwegian tundra.
The tundra is a beautiful place with plenty of hills and valleys, a lot 
of temples, mysterious buildings, and a strange town all throughout but 
mostlyconcentrated in the middle.

But a day in, you realize that a disease is spreading, this disease is 
characterized by the blackening of the veins and degenerates your brain
to think abnormally and behave hostile and mindless.

East of the town is a coast line, and there are fishing docks and sheds.
There is a hospital, a pub, a government building for printing money and 
deciding laws and policies between the two governers of the town, a farming
area used for farming sheep, cattle and other animals, two rainwater tanks,
and a lab.
The town is situated between a mountain range, with three prominent
mountains, one is north-west, one is south-west, and the last is north-east.
There is a river flowing through the town that comes from the north and
meanders to the west stopping half-way before it reaches the coast.
There is also some ruins south of the docks, which have been turned into 
homes and a base of operations for a gang.
And there is a train-station to the south-west, from which the town sends
meat, animal products and other goods for things that the town can't make,
like concrete, wood, and such. But the trains have stopped and crashed.
Guards roam the town to stop crime, they work under the 1st governer, 
and get paid for it.
Two architects live in the town, they're employed by a family, who are an 
authority on the architecture and construction. The architects have very
opposing views.

## Day 1

You arrive in the town at the train station. There's a bonfire close to 
you, A couple kids surround the bonfire. Dialogue vaguely follows this:

Kid 1: "I didn't expect anyone to come out that train alive, after that
crash. Much less a kid. Listen... Did you come alone?"

"Yes"

Kid 1: "That's weird, never met anyone like you. Did you come here by 
accident?"

"Yes"

Kid 1: "So what's the plan? How are you gonna get back? The trains broke
down."

"I don't know. I'll survive I guess."

Kid 2: "Try your best to survive in the town. Stick with us if you'd like,
we have a camp, south of the docks. Here, take some food and water."

"Thanks."

You head into the town and spend the day mostly exploring and meeting 
the people of the town. You get a few quests and make some allies.

# Gameplay

You have health. You have hunger. You have exhaustion which you can
bring down by sleeping, but sleeping increases hunger.

You can buy food, weapons, clothing, bandages and medicine in shops 
with money. You can get money by selling stuff in shops. 
You can get money by completing quests that NPCs can give to you.
You can get food, money and supplies by robbing houses but this will
cause people to attack you and you will lose reputation.
Your health will go down by people, enemies and robbers attacking you.

You have a set time limit of 10 days to do stuff in. Quests are bound by
time. Some quests have a time limit of 2 hours to do them in, and others
have a limit of 5 days.
Quests aren't generic like: "Collect 10 chicken feathers and I will give 
you a reward.". They're more like: "I need you to investigate this band 
of criminals for information about their leader" and then you get into a 
goose chase for the leader and find out the criminals lied to you who the 
leader was and they've already wreaking havoc, and then you go to the 
guy who gave you the quest and he orders you to kill the criminals and
gives you money after you dispose of them.

You also have a diary in which quests are written down. There will be no 
markers on the map. The map will have buildings and places marked down 
with their names and the quests will tell you which place to go to, but 
won't make it super obvious on the map.
