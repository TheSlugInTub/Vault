# Atrovein

Atrovein is a medical simulation game.

You work in a hospital. The hospital has a large room right from where you enter, this is
where the healthy patients will sit and wait for you to come to check them out.
On the front of the room is a stage, on which plays will be rehearsed in the following days.
A side door to the left reveals a large room lined with beds and seperating curtains. These
beds are used for surgery and for housing lying patients. There are also instruments for 
study such as microscopes are stored in a seperated area of the room.
The side door to the right of the main hall leads to a room where surgical and medical 
instruments are stored and sterilized. 

You are the lone worker of this hospital, since the surgeon and other people left for some...
unknown reasons, and you'll have to perform surgeries and other busywork yourself.

You'll have a diary in which symptoms of common diseases are written down to identify them.

You'll have a list of administed patients, their symptoms and medical record.

In 2 days, one of your patients comes in with a mysterious disease, the likes of which you 
have never heard of. The entire hospital will soon be engulfed by it, and a large chunk of 
the country already has. The government knows this and has assigned you, one of the nation's 
greatest doctors with making a vaccine for it. You can also make a serum which is a cure if
you're good at the game.

You will need to find the nature of the Black Vein disease, study it, take blood samples,
and try to make a vaccine for it.

## Diagnostic Gameplay

This is the part where you visit the patient who is either standing somewhere or in a chair.
You will listen to what they say they have. You will ask them of their history, any 
conditions they might have, any bad habits they might have, and anything harmful they do. 
This information will get added to their patient file. You can perform a physical examination
on them to narrow down your diagnosis.
You will check them with a variety of instruments. A thermometer, an x-ray and more.
