# Game for Salamander engine

Ok so what do I want to really make here?

I could make a fighting game, like nidhogg. I really like nidhogg actually.

Interesting games:

Rain World
Dark Souls
Nidhogg 
Portal 2
Undertale
Animal Well 
Darkwood 
Cry of Fear
OneShot

Portal's quite simple, and I really like that game as well, but it's a puzzle game, and I don't think
that puzzles are really something I can make.

Cry of Fear's not really a game I would want to play.

Very loose idea: Game based on the computer
Very loose idea: Game about coming up with inventive new ways to approach problems on the fly,
                 kind of procedural in a way.

Loose mechanic: You can do something in a lot of different ways like combos, like killing enemies in ULTRAKILL.

Maybe like an immersive sim?

Loose idea: Explore an island in first person, kind of like A Short Hike. The art style has to be easy for me 
to draw though.

Maybe I could combine the challenging combat encounters of Half Life and Half Life 2 and the exploration of 
Dark Souls and Rain World, I could make something interesting.

Expanding on the island loose idea, maybe you could explore an island full of mysteries like in Animal Well, but  
on an island instead of a well. Where you have combat encounters like in Half Life where you have to think on your 
feet.

Pinned down elements:

First person
3D
Exploration based

Timeframe:

14th century England with magic, miracles and wyverns.

Mechanics:

Grappling hook would be cool
Bow
Grenades
Staff which casts spells.
Rocket jumping with grenades.
Dashing like in ULTRAKILL
Lots of weapons and combat tools that work with each other to create combos and synergies.

Story:

Could be like Darkwood, where the island is alive and is distorting all those that live in it, and you have 
to burn it down; but I think that would make it too dark... wood.

Could be like that doom 2 mod where the entire island is in le head.

You are a plague doctor in medieval England, sent on a mysterious island to try and cure the people of Corith.

Since the game is so much like Pathologic already (Definitely not in terms of gameplay), I'll be taking some inspiration from it and add
a secret ending where you go to a hidden monument called the Creator Room, where you meet a child called the Director.
You get to have a fourth wall breaking chat with him, his dialog is all the stuff I thought about while making the game and details on the 
engine.
and in the room is some cool development stuff.
