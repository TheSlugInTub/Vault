# Game Development

Upload videos about the game on youtube.

Push the game into communites (reddit, discord, forums).

Release a public demo.

Good enough is the best you should aim for. You're making a game, not a programming project.

Tip things in the player's favor because the game may seem unfair to them even when it 
was their fault.

Exaggerate the audio, make it unique. Make the player FEEL like they're doing the things 
with the sound effects.

Guide the player towards the most fun way of playing but leave room for player expression.

Give the player more than one way of doing things so the game doens't feel like the same 
each time and it gives the player choice. For example: killing an enemy only by dashing 
through them gets repetitive after a while, so give them the ability to kill them ground 
stomping, bombs, throwing spears, throwing potions to make it fun and varied.

Use calm moments to keep intense moments intense. Pace properly so that intensity isn't 
normalized.

Don't start off with a long explanation for the story, make the player experience things 
in it first hand and have characters, moments and ideas you can get attached to.
