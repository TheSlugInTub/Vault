The stress of a vowel in a russian word is not consistent.

## Vowel Reduction Rules

When a, o are before the stressed syllable, they are pronounced as schwa.
When e, Я are before the stressed syllable, they are pronounced as ih.

## Rules

There are no articles, such as 'a', 'an' or 'the'.

Words have three genders in Russian: male, female and neuter.

Nouns ending with a consonant are most likely male.
Nouns ending with a 'a' or 'ya' are most likely female.
Nouns ending with a 'o', 'e' are most likely neuter.

Stress always goes on Й if it's present in the word. But the little streak
on top of the Й is not written most of the the time.

Stress rarely goes on Ы or И.

# Personal Pronouns 

Я means I.
Tы means you;
Oн means he.
Oнa' means she.
Oнo' means it.
Oни' means they.

There is no verb: "to be". You just say "I [noun]".

I am a teacher.
Я Учитель.

I am a bachelor of medicine.
Я бакалавр медицины

You are a surgeon.
Tы хирург.

# Hardness

The ye, yo, yu vowels make consonants before them soft.

The hard sign divides a word. It saves the hardness of a consonant before it.

# Voiced and Unvoiced Consonants 

Voiced consonants make other consonants surrounding them, voiced.
Unvoiced consonants make other consonants surrounding them, unvoiced.

# Verbs

Verbs in Russian change form based on who is doing them.

Subject	Endings
I	                        -ю, -у	-ю, -у
you (singular, familiar)	-ешь, -ёшь	-ишь
he, she, it	                -ет, -ёт -ит
we	                        -ем, -ём -им
you (plural, polite)     	-ете, -ёте -ите
they	                    -ют, -ут -ят, -ат

You can often emit the subject: Я or Oн or any other and just use the appropriate verb
for the subject.

# Nouns

In Russian, nouns have three genders: male, female and neuter.
Male nouns have a consonant ending, female nouns have a -a or -я ending,
and neuter nouns end with -o or -e.

Noun gender can change other parts of a sentence or verb.

# Adjectives

Adjectives change form based on the pronoun in use.

Male	Consonant
Neuter	-о
Female	-а
Plural	-ы, -и

For example:
Я богат.
Она богата.
Оно богато.

I'm rich.
She's rich.
It's rich.
