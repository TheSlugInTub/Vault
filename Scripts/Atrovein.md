So I had a thought in my head to create a medical simulation game. [Yaps about game]

So I created a new project in Unity and modelled a hospital which is modelled (haha) after a theatre
because Pathologic.

I brought the theatre into Unity and added some props around the scene. A lot of these props were *borrowed*
from Pathologic 2, but I'll replace them later on.

I modelled an autoclave in blender because I couldn't find a model online.

But then I realized that I would need to make human models because this is a game about treating people.
But I didn't know how to model humans and characters, I can model inorganic stuff pretty well but not characters.

So I followed a character modelling tutorial by BranSculpts and got to work. [Yaps about what I did in the tutorial]

Blender crashed while I was trying to follow the modelling tutorial, now I'll have to redo a lot of work.

And I made a new model based on Jinx from Arkane as practice but it ended up looking nothing like her so I will 
use it in the game.

I brought the model into Unity and made a dialogue system. [Yaps about dialogue system]

Now I'll have to create a physical examination scene.
