## init

I got started on the project. [Yaps about what I'm trying to do]
I want to build a serializer for C.
I first built a parser called metabol in C++. [Yaps about metabol]
I spent a while thinking about this and the solution I've come up with is that I will write a parser to search
all header and source files to structs that have this comment before them "//// Component". It will then 
catalogue these structs.
Then in the source files, I can write some template code to serialize, print or display any of these components
and the parser will then build off this template, repeating it as many times as there are components.

Yknow what nah I'm building a template parser for C
