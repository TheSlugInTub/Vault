# Timeline:

I began working on a new engine called salamander. [Showcase of engine and all its features]
I first began making a story, inspired by Pathologic and Darkwood. [Yaps about Pathologic 2]
I then made a map. 
Then I began sculpting up some terrain in blender. 
Then I made a character controller.
I then added another collider in my engine, a mesh collider. It uses all the vertex data in 
the model to make a mesh collider with Jolt.
I then brought the full model into the engine, but it ran way too slow.
I realized that the reason was the lighting and shadow calculations were taking way too long.
